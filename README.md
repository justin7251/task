The Psychometrics Centre - Front end developer task
---------------------------------------------------
In this task, I created a list of users when the project started. It contains a list of users with pagination and can be deleted on the page.
Although there has been a problem on the service post method, but I have built the function of adding users.

Steps to follow
===============

1. On your computer create a local git repository with the code provided for this task. Do initial commit of this code. All your further commits should go to this local repository.

2. Run the service:
        
        cd ./service
        npm i
        npm run build
        npm start

3. Run the website:
        cd ./website
        npm i
        ng serve --open


*Note Add User functionlity is not working. When I tried to post to http://localhost:8080/users the service has close connection.
